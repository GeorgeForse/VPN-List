# VPN-List
A list of domains that popular VPNs use for authentication. Due to the nature of VPNs, it's best not to rely on DNS to block and instead use a proxy server such as SquidGuard on a firewall appliance.

This list is a sanitized dump of the blocklist I've been building at work to mitigate VPN usage. Blocking these hosts will prevent access to authentication for VPNs in most cases.

VPNs are quite difficult to block, so you can either use Layer 7 filtering to intelligently identify VPNs (This will break a lot of legitimate services e.g. Wi-Fi Calling) or only allow ports 80 and 443 (Having internal DNS servers which do have access to port 53) while decrypting and inspecting (or validating) SSL connections (This will also break a lot of legitimate services).

Denying literal IP hosts will also mitigate/disable many VPNs using HTTPS/Port 443 or HTTP/Port 80.

# This list breaks:
* WindScribe
* Betternet
* X-VPN
* PrivateInternetAccess
* Many Chrome/Firefox VPN Plugins
* YouTube "Unblocker" plugins
* Etc.
